We are a mostly ethical laboratory that specializes in manipulating and mutating directories of photos.<br />
Currently supported experimental procedures are outlined below:<br />
    
    Protocol 'C': Generating bar graphs of the n (n <= 10) dominant colors in images and storing
        a record of the dominant color graphs in a user-specified directory.
    Protocol 'D': Deleting or relocating duplicate or near-duplicate images (coming soon)
    Protocol 'F': Detecting humans and relocating photos that feature them as the subject matter. This protocol
        uses Haar Cascade XML files and is thus subject to the face-detection limitations of these files.
    Protocol 'S': Shrinking photos according to a specified height or width. A photo expansion option is unavailable 
        due to the extremely high risk of image pixellation and uglification.
    Protocol 'T': Detecting and translating text in photos (coming soon)
    Protocol 'W': Analyzing screenshots of workout machines and generating a report (coming soon)

Research Notes: <br />
Due to limitations in face detection algorithms, Protocol 'F' does not have a 100% accuracy rate.
