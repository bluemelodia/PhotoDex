We are a mostly ethical laboratory that specializes in manipulating and mutating directories of photos.<br />
Currently supported experimental procedures are outlined below:<br />
    
    Protocol 'C': 
        [Sub-Protocol 'D']: Generating bar graphs of the n (n <= 10) dominant colors in images and storing
            a record of the dominant color graphs in a user-specified directory. 
        
	Sample Inputs:
		Relative Path to Source Directory: ../Profile_Pictures
		Relative Path to Destination Directory: ../Profile_Pictures_Original
		I choose: C
		Enter 'Q' to query directory, 'D' to calculate dominant colors: D

	[Sub-Protocol 'Q']: Search an directory and rank its images by color similarity to a user-specified
            query image. The ranked images are displayed to the user, who is given the option to specify
            which images they would like to move to a specified destination directory.
    Protocol 'D': Deleting or relocating duplicate or near-duplicate images (coming soon)
    Protocol 'F': Detecting humans and relocating photos that feature them as the subject matter.
    Protocol 'S': Shrinking photos according to a specified height or width. A photo expansion option 
        is unavailable due to the extremely high risk of image pixellation and uglification.
    Protocol 'T': Detecting and translating text in photos (coming soon)
    Protocol 'W': Analyzing screenshots of workout machines and generating a report (coming soon)

Research Notes: <br />
Due to limitations in face detection algorithms, Protocol 'F' does not have a 100% accuracy rate.
