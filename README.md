We specialize in manipulating and mutating directories of photos.<br />
Currently supported experimental procedures are outlined below:<br />
    Protocol 'C': Sorting photos by dominant colors (coming soon)<br />
    Protocol 'D': Deleting or relocating duplicate or near-duplicate images (coming soon)<br />
    Protocol 'F': Detecting sentient beings (humans and cats) and relocating<br />
	photos that feature them as the subject matter<br />
    Protocol 'S': Shrinking photos according to a specified height or width<br />
