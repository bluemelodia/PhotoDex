We specialize in manipulating and mutating directories of photos.
Currently supported experimental procedures are outlined below:
    Protocol 'C': Sorting photos by dominant colors (coming soon)
    Protocol 'D': Deleting or relocating duplicate or near-duplicate images (coming soon)
    Protocol 'F': Detecting sentient beings (humans and cats) and relocating
	photos that feature them as the subject matter
    Protocol 'S': Shrinking photos according to a specified height or width
